## About Me
#### As a person
Hi! My name is James Chung, and I am currently a ~~third~~ second year student at UCSD majoring in Computer Science. (I'm looking to graduate in 3 years instead of 4, so what does that make me? A sophomore? junior? Who knows.)  
Anyways, some interests:
- Video games
- Tennis (been a while since I last played though)
- Coding
- Anime

#### As a programmer
Admittedly, I don't know nearly as much as I would like to.  
Languages learned:  
1. C/C++
2. C# (also a very small amount)  
3. Java
4. Python (a very small amount)
5. SystemVerilog
I have experience debugging using valgrind, GDB, and gprof. (I swear gprof can be so unhelpful sometimes, point in case with allocation being called, but I don't know where it's called the most: 
` ...std::allocator<char> > const&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > `. Maybe I just don't understand how to use it well.)
Considering that most of my classes have not explicitly had me use an IDE, trying out VSCode for the first time.  
Besides projects created for courses I've taken, I don't really have any noteworthy projects, at least since highschool. ~~I should really find more motivation to make some.~~  

    
**As most students say here at UCSD:**  
> Start early, Start often  
which I try to practice, but obviously it's [not the easiest](http://gph.is/1rnPFh5) to always stick to this rule.
