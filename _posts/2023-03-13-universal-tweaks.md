#### Languages/Tools Used
Java, Mixin Sponge
#### Responsibilities
Implementation of various performance-related and quality-of-life related tweaks for discontinued mods
#### Description
An open-source Minecraft mod dedicated to consolidating bugfixes and tweaks for a version (Minecraft 1.12.2) that no longer receives updates, but is still very popular in the community. I have contributed over 40 tweaks to the original source, varying from improving performance of other no longer maintained mods, to adding community-desired quality-of-life features that are not invasive to the base game.
Still continuing to support the mod author and other mod-pack developers by listening to feedback and bug reports.
