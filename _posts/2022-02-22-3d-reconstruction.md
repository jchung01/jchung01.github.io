#### Languages/Tools Used
Python, OpenCV, SIFT
#### Responsibilities
Implementation of 3D reconstruction using OpenCV
#### Description
A project visualizing a 3D reconstruction from a collection of 2D images. Uses the SIFT algorithm to extract keypoints and descriptors, with outlier removal to cleanup points in camera correspondences.

(I no longer have a copy of the dataset required to rebuild the project, so unfortunately a demo is not available.)
