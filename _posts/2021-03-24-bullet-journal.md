#### Description
Worked in a team of 7 using Agile methodologies to develop a journal web-app in the Bullet Journal style. Designed for quick logging of tasks and goals, users can log entries meant for immediate reference or upcoming tasks for a future date. I played a key role in implementing a flagging function for any bullet entry so that these specific entries can also be reflected in an "Important" log. The logs with their entries use IndexedDB to stored them in local, persistent databases. This allows the user to leave and return to their journal at any time.

Beyond the technical aspects, I found this project important for developing collaborative and communication skills during the design and devlopment process.
