#### Description
Data science meta-project analyzing a large collection of other projects from iterations of a data science (COGS108: Data Science in Practice) course. I worked together in a team of 5 to investigate and report on observable trends in other teams' (both in the same quarter and past quarters) projects. We were particularly interested in gauging popularity of medical health topics considering this was during the COVID time period.
