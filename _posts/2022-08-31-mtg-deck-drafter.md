#### Languages/Tools Used
JavaScript (AppsScript), Google Sheets
#### Responsibilities
Implementation of random deck drafting
#### Description
A script to generate decks for the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. I made this while helping a friend design a custom set of cards, who wanted to be able to make randomized decks from the card pool to hand out to playtesters. When the "Generate Pack" button is pressed, a new random deck is created with a set number of cards from each rarity pool.

Demo (requires making a copy to use buttons): [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYOGRLOtCor4ZlI3M-WxGQrkjK9iqpaOu948pUcz-10/edit?usp=sharing)
