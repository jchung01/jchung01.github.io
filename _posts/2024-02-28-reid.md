#### Languages/Tools Used
Java, Mixin Sponge
#### Responsibilities
Refactoring of original codebase and added compatibilty for other mods
#### Description
An open-source fork of a Minecraft 1.12.2 mod primarily focused on extending the hardcoded id limits present in this version. This is especially catered towards modpack authors who wish to deliver a rich, unique experience by curating a collection of mods and implementing custom content, but were limited by the amount of content they could add before the game would no longer run. 

I refactored the entire mod to offer better compatiblity with other mods that manipulate bytecode, as well as adding more id support for mods and various bugfixes with the original source.
