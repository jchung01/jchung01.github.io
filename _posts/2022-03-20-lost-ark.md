#### Languages/Tools Used
Python, OpenCV, PyAutoGUI
#### Responsibilities
Automated movement and ability usage for infinitely farming dungeons
#### Description
A mostly proof-of-concept Python script that was able to automate character movement and combat for farming materials in a dungeon for the game Lost Ark.

Game interaction is implemented using automated keypresses and timings, some with and some without game context. It uses OpenCV's template matching with periodic captures of the game screen to detect certain states of the game. This is used to perform necessary actions for entering/advancing/exiting the dungeon. The dungeon is divided into stages, and the player needs to navigate to a certain area in the stage to advance, so position and direction is extrapolated by reading and masking the in-game map.
